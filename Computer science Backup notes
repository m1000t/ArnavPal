  <article style="padding: 5px; border: 3px solid blue;">
      <ol type=1>

    <li> 
<!--1 -->    The wireless mouse is connected via Bluetooth or infrared radio waves there is a. The USB plug is connected through the motherboard. </Li> 
<br>
 <!-- 2 -->   <li>The mouse is moving so we can put the cursor over the save button, to do that the mouse creates an interrupt, the interrupt basically a way to tell the computer that an event needs to be processed.</li>
<br>
<!-- 3 --> <li>Then the mouse is moved on top of the save button so that we are able to press the save button. This happens because of the mouse's optical sensors. The mouse has CMOS sensors which help the mouse move on the screen, this happens as we move the mouse on a surface in a direction. </li>
<br>
<!-- 4 --> <li>The operating system then keeps track of where the cursor should be on your screen. The screen Hz also allows you to see the mouse smoother the higher the Hz the smoother the movement.</li>
<br>
<!-- 5 --><li>When the mouse cursor is over the save file then the mouse is clicked. </li>
<br>
<!-- 6 --> <li> Then the mouse trigger in the mouse takes place and the mouse sends an electric signal to the bus, a bus in the computer makes the components communicate inside the computer.</li>
<br>
<!-- 7 --> <li>Then the Motherboard takes the input from the USB chip that is connecting the mouse and communicates with the CPU,then sends signals to the CPU then the CPU takes the data and converts the data into bits also known as ones and zeros, or takes the input(mouse click) and turns it into an output on our screen.</li>
<br>
<!-- 8 --> <li>There are 3 key stages during this process, fetch,  decode and execute. The CPU then can process events going on in the computer.</li>
<br>
<!-- 9 --> <li>The CPU then fetches the data coming from the motherboard and decodes it to execute the process the CPU works with the ram to process the event faster. The RAM process the data faster as it stores data on a short-term base, unlike the SSD and HDD.</li>
<br>
<!-- 10 --> <li>That's why it matters how many cores are in your CPU and the GB of ram you have in your computer, some CPUs nowadays have employed a technology called multithreading which allows the Computer to execute two or more events at once.</li>
<br>
<!-- 11 --> <li>The CPU transfers the data to the RAM which then  access the memory to perform the click.</li>
<br>
<!-- 12 --> <li> Meaning the ram can process things faster for example the higher the ram in your computer the better an ideal number of ram would be 16GB </li>
<br>
<!-- 13 --> <li>The CPU performs the mouse click by communicating with the ram this all happens in nanoseconds. The ram uses its memory and finds the mouse's routine and performs the task.</li>
<br>
<!-- 14 --> <li>Then the mouse click has been executed as the CPU stops any other functions and prioritizes your mouse click. Also known as the interrupt in which the CPU executes a task while interrupting other tasks. </li>
<br>
<!-- 15 --> <li>The button now has been clicked which leads to the CPU again decoding the information and communicating with the RAM to access the SSD.</li>
<br>
<!-- 16 --> <li>Then we are given a choice on where to save the file, which we get to decide if we want to save the file on our hard drive or the SSD. We choose the SSD as thats where we want our local file to be saved.</li>
<br>
<!-- 17 --> <li> The CPU then again helps execute the function, the CPU then communicates with the ram which communicates with the SSD. </li>
<br>
<!-- 18--> <li>An SSD is a solid state drive which is another type of data storage in your computer. The SSD is mainly used for business and gaming as the drive can be easily erased, transferred and written. Most businesses use SSD as data can be transferred easily and the drive is really fast compared to HDD.</li>
<br>
<!-- 19 --> <li> When the ram communicates with SSD to save the file. The ram is processing how to save and where to save the file.</li>
<br>
<!-- 20 -->  <li>The process behind how the file is saved is onto the solid state drive :</li>
        <br>
<!-- 21 --> <li> The non-volatile memory known as NAND flash, which is called for the specific logic gate it uses, is mostly used in solid-state drives. While volatile memory loses data without a power source, the non-volatile memory may maintain recorded information without a constant power supply.</li>
<br>
<!-- 22 --> <li>Data storage in NAND is based on binary code, a 0s and 1s coding scheme.</li>
<br>
<!-- 23 --> <li> Then the SSD writes the data in pages rather than sector to sector like the HDD</li>
<br
<!-- 24 --> <li>  After that, the local file is saved onto the SSD. As the SSD writes the file onto its disk.</li>
